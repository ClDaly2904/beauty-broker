                    <p><b>1. Cleanse -</b>Washing your face is the most basic and an essential step of any routine! The
                        right formula cleanses your skin without stripping your skins natural oils. Don't forget to
                        double cleanse at night to ensure your skin can reset.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <p><b>2. Treatment -</b> Use a treatment step to target your skin concern. Whether it be niacinimide
                        to
                        support your skin barrier, alpha arbutin to help prevent hyperpigmentation or vitamin-c to help
                        brighten skin, this is the time to make a difference!

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <p><b>3. Moisturiser -</b> Moisturizer hydrates skin and locks in all the other products.
                        Look for a lightweight moisturiser in the morning and a thicker cream in the
                        evening.</p>

                    <p><b>4. Sunscreen -</b> The single most important step in any routine! Wearing sunscreen alone has
                        been proven to improve skin condition and health. It protects against sun damage- the greatest
                        culprit in aging.</p>
